GIS data for the U.S.-Mexico border fence (perhaps a wall in the future)

### Fields in the data

The first six fields are the primary fields of interest for most users. The remaining fields are to preserve references to OpenStreetMap data from [our original fence map project](http://cironline.org/blog/post/surprising-tools-cir-used-map-us-mexico-border-fence-6255). While the current fence data has not been imported into OpenStreetMap, we hope to do so in the future.
